## Lecture 11 - ordered categories

Trolley problem example

we're going to look at this problem with the trolley dataset, which has responses from 331 individuals to 30 trolley problems across the action/intention/impact types. responses are how appropriate the action is from 1 to 7. this is not a count variable and it's not metric - it's bounded 1-7.

```{r}
library(rethinking)
data("Trolley")
```

estimand is how the action, intention, and contact influence response to a trolley story? so we need to know how the influences of each are associated with other variables:

we're working with ordered categories - categories are discrete types ("type of animal"), but ordered categories are discrete types where the order matters ("good, bad, awful")

the weird thing about these are that there are anchor points in the data - like the midpoint, and that the distance between the points is not necessarily constant (people don't like to use extreme values)

the machinery of these is SUPER weird I'd have to go back to the slides if I tried to deal with this

to make this into a GLM - we need to make it a function of variables by stratifying the cutpoints and adding an offset to each cutpoint by a value of the linear model (phi sub i? help)
