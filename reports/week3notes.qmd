## Lecture 5 - Elemental Confounds

We're going to talk today about things that happen during the estimator that can cause issues with our estimate.

#### Assocation & Causation

Statistical recipes must defend against confounding, which is a feature of the sample and how we use it that misleads us

### The Fork

Z is a common cause of X and Y: X & Y are associated because they share the common cause Z. Once stratified by Z, there's no association between X and Y - so, at each level of Z, X and Y are independent (not associated) with one another.

in the above example, you can see that at z values of 0 or 1 X and Y aren't correlated (correlation is out of 1, above 0.3 typically considered correlated)

so, example: why do regions of the USA with higher rates of marriage also have higher rates of divorce? Does marriage cause divorce?

estimand is causal effect of marriage on divorce

it is often conveneient to standardize by the mean in linear regression. standardizing means subtract mean and divide by standard deviation - it makes it easier to choose sensible prior and makes computation work better.

The above code produces this \^ which is bad - they're totally different, the slopes are too extreme,

better priors:

I think this below is plotting the priors which can be useful?

The slope is not the causal effect of M - that's often reported but it's not quite right. We're going to do it the principled way which works when we get to more complex models. We do a simulation:

we play god on M - we delete the arrows going into M to simulate the causal effect of M on D
